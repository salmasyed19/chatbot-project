# Intents-Based Chatbot with Streamlit and NLP

The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input based on intents. Built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Logistic Regression**, the chatbot extracts intents and entities from user input to provide meaningful responses. The chatbot is deployed via **Streamlit**, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts:
1. **NLP Techniques and Logistic Regression**: The chatbot is trained on a dataset containing labeled intents and entities. NLP techniques such as TF-IDF Vectorization are used to process user input, and Logistic Regression is employed for intent classification.
2. **Chatbot Interface with Streamlit**: The interface is built using Streamlit, which provides a simple web framework for creating the chatbot interface. Users can input text and receive responses from the chatbot in an interactive manner.
